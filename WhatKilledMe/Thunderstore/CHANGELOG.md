<summary>1.0.3 </summary>

* Fixed printing "with" even if there is no skill name to get.
* Added more robust detection if skill name needs to be replaced with SkillDef name.
  * _On this note, check out [DamageSourceForEnemies](https://thunderstore.io/package/LordVGames/DamageSourceForEnemies/), while there aren't any localized strings to get, you will get skill def names and they are usually relatively close to whatever skill does._
