# LobbyRulebookDefSaver
Saves lobby rules into config so they are kept between game restarts. Saves are done either on rule change (disabled by default) or on button click in rules submenu.

Main differences from other mods:

* [LobbyVotesSave](https://thunderstore.io/package/KingEnderBrine/LobbyVotesSave/) - saves rules by index, so whenever you add anything to the game, be it item, difficulty, artifact, equipment, etc. then everything will be shifted. It is however better if you don't modify your mod pack that much and it saves into your Steam cloud save folder, so LobbyRulebookDefSaver is more of a sidegrade.
* [ItemBlacklist](https://thunderstore.io/package/Thrayonlosa/ItemBlacklist/) - only saves items and does some stuff to DropTables that break stuff with other mods with no option to disable it, mainly [ArtifactOfLimit](https://thunderstore.io/package/viliger/ArtifactOfLimit/).
