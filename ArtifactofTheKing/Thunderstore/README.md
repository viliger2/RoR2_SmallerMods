# DISCLAMER
This is fixed version of [Artifact of the King by Blobface](https://thunderstore.io/package/Blobface/Artifact_of_the_King/). It was made without permission as for original maker could not be reached. The following fixes have been made:

* Mod is fixed for SoTS
* Sky Leap triple wave was not functional in the original release, so I fixed it with option to disable it.
* Icons for artifact are moved to asset bundle
* Mod now uses language file instead of hardcoded strings

Below is the original readme with changelog moved to separate file.

## Artifact of the King
artifact that makes Mithrix more difficult. Mithrix is balanced around first loop. Phase 1-3 tend to become trivial on later loops, or with good RNG. This  mod is intended to make Mithrix more difficult to better scale with powerful builds.

## What's different
- Hammer Slam (primary) now launches 16 of his Phase 4 orbs in a circle, and has reduced cooldown, and has 2 max stocks.
- Hammer Dash (secondary) now launches a fan of 10 lunar shards, has reduced cooldown, and has 2 max stocks
- Slide (utility) now launches a shotgun of 5 lunar shards, has reduced cooldown, and has 4 max stocks
- Sky Leap (special) now launches triple the wave projectiles and activates much faster. Fun Surprise in phase 3.
- Ultimate (alternate special) now launches more waves faster
- Lunar Shards have improved homing
- Sprinting Lunar Shards fires much more projectiles in a much wider spread.
- Mithrix has generally improved movement stats that make him more agile and give him better responses to aerial kiting.

## Known Issues
- Mithrix's AI tends to not use his primary skill if his movement increases

## Future Plans
- AI changes
- Reward for beating Mithrix with the artifact on
- Burst Damage protection
- Add config to make the effects constant instead of artifact based
