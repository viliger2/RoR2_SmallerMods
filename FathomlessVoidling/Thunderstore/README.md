# Overview

A Voidling rework mod that makes the fight more fun. Stats are reduced by default but can be increased in either the in-game config or the R2Modman config (for those who want to tweak things even more). Makes the Void Locus an alternate moon by adding a stage 5 portal, removing void fog from void pillars, and adds item cauldrons (Can toggle the alt moon/void fog).
