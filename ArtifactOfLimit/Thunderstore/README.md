# Artifact of Limit
Adds an artifact that limits available items on run to run basis. Main use case is to reduce item bloat without sacrificing overall item variety.

At the start of each run 21-24 (configurable) number of items are selected for Tiers 1, 2 and 3 each. Selection is done by Damage, Healing and Utility tags within given proportions (configurable). Boss and Lunar items are untouched, Void items are selected only if their "original" form is available (can be disabled in the config, then all void items will be added), if no corruptible items are in the pool then random 5 (configurable) void items are added to the item pool, just so void seeds can actually give you something.

Selection respects rule book. When playing with command locked icon will be shown, just like if you were to disable items via rule book.
