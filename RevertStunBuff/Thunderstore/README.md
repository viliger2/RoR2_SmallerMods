# RevertStunBuff.
Reverts stun buffs to how they were pre-SoTS.

# Background stuff
Basically, pre-SoTS stuns would refresh their duration. With SoTS Gearbox decided that stuns instead should stack. 


As a result something like supressive fire results in absurdly long stun compared to how it was before.
