# DISCLAMER
This is fixed version of [OldFathomlessVoidling by Smxrez and Nuxlar](https://thunderstore.io/package/Smxrez/OldFathomlessVoidling/). It was made with permission from both Smxrez and Nuxlar. The following fixes have been made:

* Mod is fixed for SoTS
* Some code improvements to rely less on hooks but not enough to call the code "good".
* Networking is not tested and chances are it doesn't work (due to original spicy code).
* RiskOfOptions is not longer a hard dependency.
* Some additional changes that can be found in change log.

Below is the original readme.

# Overview

A Voidling rework mod that makes the fight more fun. Stats are reduced by default but can be increased in either the in-game config or the R2Modman config (for those who want to tweak things even more). Makes the Void Locus an alternate moon by adding a stage 5 portal, removing void fog from void pillars, and adds item cauldrons (Can toggle the alt moon/void fog).
